# Fall 2024 CS 3503 Computer Organization and Architecture Checkers Game
## Rami Elmostafa
### Purpose of this project: 
- Provide hands-on experience with low-level data handling, including binary arithmetic.
- Highlight the efficiency and practicality of bitwise operations and binary arithmetic in applications such as game development.
- Reinforce understanding of data representation and manipulation in binary formats.
- Foster a deeper understanding of Boolean algebra and binary arithmetic through practical applications.
#### Functionality Requirements
The utility class must include methods for: 
 - Setting a specific bit. 
 - Clearing a specific bit. 
 - Toggling a specific bit. 
 - Getting the value of a specific bit. 
 - Performing basic binary arithmetic (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division). 
 - Converting data between decimal, binary, and hexadecimal formats. 
 - Methods should work for various data types (Byte, short, int, long or their equivalents).
##### Bitboard Checker's Application Requirements
Implement a bitboard that represents the checkers board, using the utility class. 
 - Demonstrate the bitboard's ability to: 
 - Represent and update the positions of the checkers pieces. 
 - Calculate and validate moves using binary arithmetic (e.g., shifting pieces using multiplication). 
 - Check for legal moves, captures, and conditions using bitwise operations. 
 - Display the checkers board state in binary and hexadecimal formats.
###### Visual Representation
 - Implement a method to visually represent the Checker's board state on a console or graphical interface, showing binary and hexadecimal formats.
